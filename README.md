# jerry-bot

Jerry-bot -- a (not so) simple Discord bot, featuring a variety of random features, including an AI chatbot, auto-reply system, and more.

As you may be able to tell by the sheer number of deprecated features, this bot is a work in progress and is not guaranteed to be stable or functional. Jerry's been completely rewritten several times, so don't be surprised if things break, and they will.

## Features

> [!note]
> Jerry is being rewritten at the moment, so not all features are currently functional.

### Mostly-Complete Features

- **commands** - A random set of application commands, some of which rely on external APIs
- **auto-reply** - Regex-based system to reply to messages based on content. Now fully supports native interactions.
- **music** - A discord music player with the ability to easily import music and fancy interactions. (Missing UI elements, file based import system needs reworking)

### Incomplete/Need Reworking

- **gemini** - Chatbot system using Gemini API (Being rewritten)

### Not Implemented (Yet)

- **stickers** - A sticker system that allows users to create and use custom stickers.

### Future Features (🤨)

- (Maybe) **price-tracker** - A system to track prices of items on various e-commerce platforms and notify users of price drops. (Previously a partially integrated feature on splat-bot)
