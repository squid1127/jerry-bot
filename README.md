# jerry-bot

Jerry-bot -- a (not so) simple Discord bot, featuring a variety of random features, including an AI chatbot, auto-reply system, and more.

## Disclaimer

Jerry bot is designed for personal use by squid1127 and is not intended for public use. Jerry-bot's code base is open source so that others may learn from it and see how it works, but it is not designed to be deployed by others. Use at your own risk.

As you may be able to tell by the sheer number of deprecated features, this bot is a work in progress and is not guaranteed to be all that stable or functional. Jerry's been completely rewritten several times, so don't be surprised if things break, and they will.

## Stable Branch

Rather than having formal releases, Jerry-bot uses a `stable` branch to provide a working version of the bot for production use (see above). The `main` branch is where active development occurs and may contain unstable or incomplete features.

## Features

> [!note]
> Jerry is being rewritten at the moment, so not all features are currently functional.

### Mostly-Complete Features

- **commands** - A random set of application commands, some of which rely on external APIs
- **auto-reply** - Regex-based system to reply to messages based on content. Now fully supports native interactions.
- **music** - A discord music player with the ability to easily import music and fancy interactions. (Missing UI elements, file based import system needs reworking)

### Incomplete/Need Reworking

- **gemini** - (r3) Sophisticated AI chatbot system leveraging Google Gemini. (Being rewritten)

### Not Implemented (Yet)

- **stickers** - A sticker system that allows users to create and use custom stickers.

### Future Features (🤨)

- (No) **price-tracker** - A system to track prices of items on various e-commerce platforms and notify users of price drops. (Previously a partially integrated feature on splat-bot)
