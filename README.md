# jerry-bot

Jerry-bot -- a (not so) simple Discord bot, featuring a variety of random features, including an AI chatbot, auto-reply system, and more.

As you may be able to tell by the sheer number of deprecated features, this bot is a work in progress and is not guaranteed to be stable or functional. Jerry's been completely rewritten several times, so don't be surprised if things break, and they will.

## Features

> [!note]
> Jerry is being rewritten at the moment, so not all features are currently functional.

### Mostly-Complete Features

- **commands** - A random set of application commands, some of which rely on external APIs

### Incomplete/Need Reworking

### Not Implemented (Yet)

- **stickers** - A sticker system that allows users to create and use custom stickers.

### Future Features (ðŸ¤¨)
